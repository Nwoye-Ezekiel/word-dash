# Project overwiew

Word dash is an online typing game where players must type various texts
in the quickest time possible. In order to complete the game, the player
must rapidly and accurately type in words, or individual letters,
numbers, or other keys, that appear on the screen. This game serves as
both a challenge and a way to improve one's typing skills. It
contains amazing features that let you customize the game to your
liking, such as the ability to choose or make your own timer, create
custom texts, and it also provides an analysis of your typing skills,
which includes your words per minute (WPM) and accuracy. The timer begins counting down
immediately the game begins, and if you are unable to finish typing
before the timer expires, the game ends and you lose points.
I hope you like it!
